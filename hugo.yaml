    content: |-
      I am a CEO of [Road Balance](https://www.roadbalance.com/) and also robotics software engineer.

      Among the various robots, I am especially interested in "Mobile Robots'', "Autonomous Driving", and "Robot Automation". 
      If we, human beings, can automate an assortment of repetitive and dangerous tasks through robots, we can focus more on creative tasks that the task only we can do. 
      However, there are still many technical challenges to be solved for robotics to enter into our lives. 
      So as an engineer, my life's goal is to solve these challenges, make robots more popular through business, and finally make our world comfortable and happy.

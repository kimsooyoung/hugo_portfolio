    content: |-
      I am a robotics software engineer and CEO of [Road Balance](https://www.roadbalance.com/), South Korea.

      “Robotics” is a rapidly developing field that requires a variety of knowledge. 
      I have multiple interests and really like to acquire new knowledge, thus I love my job and think it is a Play, not a Work. 
      In addition, I continue to do community, open-source activities, and educational activities because I love sharing and developing my robotics knowledge with someone else.
